\section{Behavior Tree Notation \& Syntax}

\subsection{Node Tags}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|c|X|}
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Graphical Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ \hline
Original &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Tags/Original} & No traceability status indicates that the behavior is stated in the original requirements. The color ``green'' is used for original requirements.\\ \hline
Implied & \includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Tags/Implied} & The ``+'' traceability status indicates that the behavior is not explicitly stated in the original requirements but is implied by the requirement. The color ``yellow'' is used for implied behavior.\\ \hline
Missing &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Tags/Missing}  & The ``-'' traceability status indicates that the behavior is missing from the original requirements and is needed for completeness. The color ``red'' is used for missing behavior.\\ \hline
Design &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Tags/Updated} & The ``+-'' traceability
status indicates that the behavior is a refinement of the original requirements, indicating that the behavior is implied but the detail to describe it is missing.\\ \hline
Updated &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Tags/Refinement}  & The ``++' traceability status indicates that the behavior has been added in the post-development or maintainence phase. The color ``blue'' is used for updated behavior. Where there are different series of changes / upgrades we use ++v1.0, ++v2.0, etc to indicate the particular upgrade series.\\ \hline
Deleted & \includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Tags/Deleted} & The ``--'' traceability status indicates that the behavior has been deleted from the behavior tree. The color ``grey'' is used for deleted behavior, but the nodes may also be hidden optionally by using tool support.
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{Basic Nodes}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|c|X|}
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Graphical Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ \hline
State Realisation &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/StateRealisation} & Component C realises state s.\\ \hline
System State Realisation &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/SystemStateRealisation}& This is a state realisation decorated with a double box to indicate the component is a system component in the current context. There can only be one system component in each context.\\ \hline
Selection &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/Selection} & If condition $b$ evaluates to true, then pass control to child nodes otherwise terminate.\\ \hline
Event &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/Event} & Wait until event $e$ is received.\\ \hline
Guard &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/Guard} & Wait until condition $b$ evaluates to true, then pass control to child nodes.\\ \hline
Internal Output &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/IOEvent}  & Generate input $e$ and send to the system.\\ \hline
Internal Input &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/IIEvent} & Wait for input $e$ from the system.\\ \hline
External Output &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/EOEvent} & Generate output $e$ and send to the environment.\\ \hline
External Input &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/EIEvent} & Wait for
input $e$ to be received from the environment.\\ \hline
Empty Node&\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/BasicNodes/Empty} & Empty Nodes can be used together with labels to be origins or destinations of node operators. Empty Nodes are also useful for grouping child nodes into multiple branch types.

\subsection{Behavior Tree Composition}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|c|X|} 
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Graphical Notation} &  \textbf{Description}\\ \hline
Sequential Composition&\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Composition/Sequential} &Execute $N$, passing control to tree $T$. The behavior of concurrent BTs may be interleaved between $N$ and $T$.\\ \hline
Atomic Composition&\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Composition/Atomic} & Execute $N_1$ immediately followed by $N_2$, passing control to tree $T$. The behavior of concurrent BTs may not be interleaved between $N_1$ and $N_2$.\\ \hline
Parallel Branching&\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Composition/Parallel} &  Execute $N$, passing control to both $T_1$ and $T_2$.\\ \hline
Alternative Branching&\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Composition/Alternative}& 
A nondeterministic choice is made between $T_1$ and $T_2$, depending on which is ready to execute (not blocked)
\end{tabularx}


\subsection{Node Operators}
\begin{itemize}
\item Operators on source nodes match against the Component, Behavior, Behavior Type and Label (if present) of the destination node.
\item An operator may be prefixed by a label and a fullstop to refer to a destination node with a label e.g. $lbl.^{\wedge}$ indicates to revert to destination node with label $lbl$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|c|X|}
\textbf{Type} & \textbf{Graphical Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ \hline 
Reference &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Operators/Reference} & Behave as the destination node. The destination node must appear in an alternative branch to the origin.\\ \hline
Reversion &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Operators/Reversion} & Behave as the destination node. The destination node must be an ancestor. All sibling behaviour is terminated.\\ \hline
Branch Kill &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Operators/BranchKill} & Terminate all behavior associated with destination tree.\\ \hline
Synchronisation &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Operators/Synchronisation} & Wait for destination node (or nodes).\\ \hline
May &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Operators/May} & The node may execute normally, or may have no effect.\\ \hline
Conjunction &\includegraphics{figs/AppendixB/Operators/Conjunction} & The operators \&, $|$ and $XOR$ correspond to logical conjunction, disjunction and exclusive or respectively.\\
