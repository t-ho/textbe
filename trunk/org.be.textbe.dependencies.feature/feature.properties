description = Behavior Engineering (BE) is an integrated discipline that supports systems and software engineering of large-scale, dependable software-intensive systems. BE employs a graphical Modeling Language (BML) to construct behavioral, compositional and structural integrated views from natural language descriptions to validate the requirements of proposed systems.\r\nTextBE provides a an editor for a textual representation of BML, including interactive visualization and export in various formats for publication.

This capability is provided with\r\nthe intent of allowing such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products.\r\nInformation about packaging Installable Software is available at\r\nhttp://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html ("Specification").\r\n\r\nYou may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install Installable Software.\r\nYou shall be responsible for enabling the applicable license agreements relating to the\r\nInstallable Software to be presented to, and accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology\r\nin accordance with the Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and\r\nmaking it available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your\r\nagreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the following:\r\n\r\n1. A series of actions may occur ("Provisioning Process") in which a user may execute\r\nthe Provisioning Technology on a machine ("Target Machine") with the intent of installing,\r\nextending or updating the functionality of an Eclipse-based product.\r\n2. During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third party\r\nInstallable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to the Target Machine.\r\n3. Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and conditions that\r\ngovern the use of the Installable Software ("Installable Software Agreement") and such\r\nInstallable Software Agreement shall be accessed from the Target Machine in accordance\r\nwith the Specification. Such Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the\r\nterms and conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance by\r\nthe end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable Software Agreement. Upon such\r\nindication of agreement by the user, the provisioning Technology will complete installation\r\nof the Installable Software.\r\n\r\nCryptography\r\n\r\nContent may contain encryption software.
