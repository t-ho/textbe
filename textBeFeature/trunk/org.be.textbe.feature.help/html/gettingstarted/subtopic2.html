	<h1>Behavior Modeling Language</h1>
	<p>Integration of requirements via the integrated views discovers
		inadequacies in a set of requirements, in the same way putting
		together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle allows us to discover if some
		pieces are missing and/or some do not fit. The single integrated
		behavioral view (IBT-Integrated Behavior Tree) of a set of
		requirements that behavior trees allow us to construct represents an
		essential criterion of fitness that should be applied to every set of
		requirements used to develop a system. The integrated compositional
		view (ICT- Integrated Composition Tree), encapsulates a specially
		structured view of the complete system vocabulary organized in a way
		designed to expose and resolve aliases and other language defects in a
		set.</p>
	<p>In contrast to some other languages the representations used by
		BML directly imply where and how they can be used to develop a system.
		They guide the design of the process for using them in the same way
		the decimal notation guides or limits how addition, etc is done. The
		key constructive processes of translation and integration follow
		directly from the representations we use to formalize the behavioural
		information and compositional information in individual requirements.
		The integrated Behavior Modeling Process (BMP) captures how BML is
		used to model a system.</p>
