	<h1>Behavior Engineering</h1>
	<p>Behavior Engineering is an integrated discipline that supports
		the systems and software engineering of large-scale, dependable
		software-intensive systems. Behavior Engineering's strength lies in
		the innovative way it squarely addresses the problems of scale,
		complexity, and imperfect knowledge associated with the large set of
		requirements needed to guide the development of challenging integrated
		systems.</p>
	<p>Behavior Engineering employs a graphical Behavior Modeling
		Language (BML) that is used to construct complete behavioral,
		compositional and structural integrated views from natural language
		descriptions of a large set of requirements for a proposed system.
		Together these three formalized views extract all the useful
		information that is needed to preserve and clarify the intension
		expressed in natural language requirements. A Behavior Modeling
		Process (BMP) used to construct the integrated views.</p>
