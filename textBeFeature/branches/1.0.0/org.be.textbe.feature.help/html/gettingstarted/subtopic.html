	<h1>Behavior Trees</h1>
	<p>Behavior Trees is a graphical representation, which has been
		given a formal semantics based on a new process algebra, allows us to
		formalize and integrate all the fragments of behavior expressed in
		individual requirements.</p>
	<p>Behavior Trees are a cognitive compromise between pictures and
		words. They take what is described in words and give it a structure
		that is designed to aid the efficiency of comprehension and clarify
		the original intent. Behavior Trees do not necessarily say more than
		natural language, or mathematics or other diagrammatic forms. Instead,
		they are an alternative that accurately and unambiguously describes
		what we say in sequential natural language. Behavior Trees use an
		integrated (non-sequential) structure that is designed specifically to
		reduce the burden on our short-term memory in understanding
		information. Behavior Trees are normally constructed by rigorous
		word-by-word translation from natural language.</p>
	<p>Several things make behavior trees interesting: they amplify our
		ability to deal with complexity; individual behavior trees may
		integrated; and, integrated behavior trees have important emergent
		properties. The notation is expressive, simple, uniform and easy to
		use. Behavior Trees can model the behavior, composition, structure and
		relations needed to accurately capture the information in such diverse
		applications as software systems, legal contracts, standards, business
		processes, medical diseases, and genetic circuits. Behavior Trees are

	<p>The Behavior Tree here captures the fragment of behavior:
		&ldquo;When a car arrives, if the gate is open the car may proceed,
		otherwise if the gate is closed, when and if the driver presses the
		button the gate will open and then the car may proceed&rdquo;. Each
		tagged rectangle refers to a component (or entity or person) in a
		state. The ?? &hellip; ?? parenthesis for a state refers to an event,
		the ? &hellip; ? parenthesis refers to a condition/decision associated
		with a component and a state parenthesised by [ &hellip; ] refers to
		the named component realizing the parenthesized state. The event
		corresponding to the car being at the entrance is the root of the
		behavior tree. The translated behavior tree captures all and only the
		behavior expressed in the natural language description. The goal
		always is to achieve repeatability when different people translate the
		same information to Behavior Trees. We do this by not altering the
		behavior vocabulary of the original text.</p>
	<p>Behavior Trees represent, in a formal graphical form, natural
		language descriptions of behavior of people, organizations,
		&ldquo;things&rdquo; and systems. Wherever there is behavior, there is
		something that is behaving &ndash; hence the component-state
		representation. Behavior involves events, conditions/decisions, and
		actions that lead to the realisation of states by components or
		entities. Translation of behavior to a behavior tree and the
		subsequent integration of behavior trees helps us uncover problems
		with original textual descriptions. What is equally important is that
		Behavior Trees amplify our ability to deal with complexity. They do
		this by providing contextually integrated descriptions of behavior.</p>
	<p>Definition: A Behavior Tree is a formal, tree-like graphical
		form that represents behavior of individual or networks of entities
		which realize or change states, make decisions, respond-to/cause
		events, and interact by exchanging information and/or passing control.
	</p>
	<p>The Behavior Tree Notation captures in a simple tree-like form
		of composed component-states what usually needs to be expressed in a
		mix of other notations. Behavior is expressed in terms of components
		realizing states, augmented by the logic and graphic forms of
		conventions found in programming languages to support actions,
		composition, events, control-flow, data-flow, and threads. Behavior
		trees accurately capture behavior expressed in the natural language
		representation of functional requirements. They strictly use the
		vocabulary of the natural language requirements but employ graphical
		forms for behavior composition in order to eliminate risk of
		ambiguity. By doing this they provide a direct and clearly traceable
		relationship between what is expressed in the natural language
		representation and its formal specification.</p>
	<p>The core elements of the Behavior Tree Notation are given below
		in the figure below. A foundation of the notation is that behavior is
		always associated with some component. Component-states which
		represent nodes of behavior are composed sequentially and concurrently
		to construct a behavior tree that represents behavior expressed in
		natural language requirements.</p>

	</p>
	<h2>Core Elements of Behavior Tree Notification</h2>
	<p>A Behavior Tree specifies state changes in components, how data
		is passed between components and how threads interact. There are
		constructs for setting and testing states of components as well as
		mechanisms for inter-process communication that include message
		passing (events), shared variable blocking and synchronization. A
		low-level process algebra with an operational semantics, BTPA has been
		defined together with a means for mechanical translation of Behavior
		Trees into BTPA. This means Behavior Trees have a precise semantics
		that supports simulation and formal verification by model-checking. A
		detailed treatment of the formal semantics of Behavior Trees as well
		as it use for simulation, model-checking, and failure modes and
		effects analysis is given elsewhere.</p>
	<h2>Requirements Translation</h2>
	<p>In practice, when translating functional requirements into
		behavior trees we often find that there is a lot of behavior that is
		either missing or is only implied by a requirement. We mark implied
		behavior with a &ldquo;+&rdquo; in the tag (and/or the colour yellow
		if colour can be shown) &ndash; we have done this the station in node
		three, Fig. [xx]. Behavior that is missing is marked with a
		&ldquo;-&ldquo; in the tag (and/or the colour red). Explicit behavior
		in the original requirement that is translated and captured in the
		behavior tree has no &ldquo;+/-&ldquo; marking, and the colour green
		is used. These conventions maximize traceability to original
		requirements. The Green-Yellow-Red traffic-light metaphor is intended
		to indicate the need for caution (yellow) and danger (red) and to draw
		attention to deficiencies in the original requirements. Subsequent
		change to a working system requirements/design is marked by a
		&ldquo;++&rdquo; in the tag and/or the colour blue, while parts that
		are delete are marked &ldquo;- - &ldquo; in the tag and/or the colour
		grey. These conventions are particularly useful when
		discussing/validating requirements and designs with stakeholders. It
		provides a clear record of the evolution of, and deficiencies in the
		original system. With the fourth sentence, which is again a compound
		sentence, detection of the train is again an event &ndash; we cannot
		predict exactly when or even if it will happen. In this case we have
		chosen to add that the train ends up being in a &ldquo;detected&rdquo;
		state &ndash; this is only implied; it is not stated in the
		requirements. We have documented it accordingly with a &ldquo;+&rdquo;
		and yellow. The word &ldquo;causes&rdquo; in the second half of the
		sentence tells us that the behavior of the north signal happens after
		the train is detected. With the second half of this sentence
		translated and composed into the tree we have the complete translation
		to a Behavior Tree (BT) for requirement R1 shown in fig xx. The
		requirements tags, R1, etc are always included in the BT to guarantee
		traceability to the original requirements. We call a behavior tree
		resulting from translation of a requirement a &ldquo;requirements
		behavior tree (RBT)&rdquo;.</p>

	<h2>Why Behavior Trees &ndash; Or Managing Complexity</h2>
	<p>Society relies heavily on the use of natural language to
		capture, describe and communicate information. People&rsquo;s
		proficiency with natural language ensures that this is a practical way
		to operate. However, whenever we have to deal with large amounts of
		information and/or copious amounts of detail, it is highly likely that
		there will be problems of ambiguity, inconsistency, incompleteness and
		redundancy in what is expressed. These problems can have serious
		consequences where accuracy of intention and accuracy of communication
		is at a premium. These problems with natural language have been
		recognised for a long time. And, as a result, practitioners in many
		disciplines have sought to design other notations, of a mathematical,
		logical, graphical or composite form, with a well-defined (and
		hopefully a formal) semantics. These notations have the intent to
		overcome the problems with natural language. In some application areas
		this strategy has been successful, while in others, like software
		engineering, where things are complex, there are still significant
		problems.</p>
	<p>This brings us to the question, &ldquo;why use Behavior
		Trees&rdquo;. We provide six main reasons below. It is these six
		properties that distinguish and give Behavior Trees an advantage over
		other currently available composite and/or individual notations.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First, the act of translation, has side-effect of clarifying
			intention. Unless the intention is clear, translation cannot proceed.
			In translation the goal is not to leave anything out, not to add
			anything, but only to capture the expressed intention.</li>
		<li>In carrying out the translation process we only need to focus
			on localized information, e.g. the current sentence. This is vitally
			important for controlling complexity. It fits well with
			people&rsquo;s short-term memory limitations. That is, people as a
			rule, are able to cope with localized detail and complexity. It is
			only when they have to deal with large amounts of detail that is
			dispersed do problems arise. This also means that the task of
			translation to behavior trees can be carried out in parallel by
			different people working on different segments of the text.</li>
		<li>While we do not claim that translation to Behavior Trees is
			algorithmically repeatable in the way long multiplication or long
			division is, we do claim, that when the process is carried out
			rigorously, translations of the same behavior approach equivalence of
			representation if not identity.</li>
		<li>The process of integrating individual behavior fragments into
			a whole also plays a vital role in clarifying intention and
			identifying incompleteness, inconsistency, and redundancy problems in
			natural language descriptions of behavior. We claim an integrated
			view, rather than multiple views, is better for clarifying intention
			and detecting defects. The process of integrating behavior trees is
			not unlike putting together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces
			can be put together one at a time, and the order in which pieces are
			put together is usually not critical. This property also makes an
			important contribution to the control of complexity where there are
			large amounts of detail and many interactions among components
			involved. This process and the integrated representation also make an
			important contribution to the preservation of intention, particularly
			when the integrated behavior is used to guide the design of systems.</li>
		<li>Once behavior is represented as an integrated behavior tree
			it is much easier to see and systematically detect various classes of
			defects that may have been embedded in, but not obvious, in the
			original natural language description of behavior. To paraphrase
			Schopenhauer, we change what we see and the way we think when we
			change representations.</li>
		<li>Once behavior has been translated and integrated, the
			resulting representation has significant emergent properties. It can
			be used systematically to derive the architecture of the system
			together with the integrated behavior of each of the individual
			components in the system.</li>
	</ul>
